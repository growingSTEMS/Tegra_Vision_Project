   *                 Use the constant AF_UNIX as the argument
   *    internet domain: used for any two hosts on the internet
   *                     use the constant AF_INET as the argument
   *
   * Second argument: type of socket.
   * Two types of sockets: stream and datagram
   *    stream: characters read in a continuous stream as if from a file or
   *            pipeline.
   *            Use SOCK_STREAM as the argument.
   *    datagram: messages are read in chunks.
   *              Use SOCK_DGRAM as the argument.
   *
   * Third Argument: protocol.
   * If the argument is a zero (which is the usual case) the OS will choose
   * the most appropriate protocol. It will choose TCP for stream and UDP for
   * datagram sockets.
   *
   * The function returns and entry into the file descriptor table (small
   * integer). Thatvalue is used for all subsequent references to the socket.
   * If the socket call faile, the value returned will be -1.
   *
   * This is a simplified description of the socket call. For more info
